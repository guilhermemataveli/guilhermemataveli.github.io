## 👨‍🔬 About me

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">

I am a Young Investigator Fellow at [INPE](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br) (funded by [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/en)) and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research](https://tyndall.ac.uk/). My work focuses on improving the accuracy and understanding of biomass burning emissions and their regional impacts. I currently lead the development of the South American Biomass Burning Inventory ([SAMBBI](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/auxilios/119054/sambbi-towards-a-new-generation-of-biomass-burning-emission-inventories/)), the first operational regional biomass burning inventory for South America.

I am particularly interested in studies related to fire, deforestation, land-use and land-cover change, protected areas, and environmental policy in the Brazilian Amazon and Brazilian savannas. I am also a member of the [TREES Lab](https://www.treeslab.org/).
